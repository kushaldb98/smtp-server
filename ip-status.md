## Template to request removal from spam lists

Sometimes we need to provide details about how we protect spam.

```txt
[My company name] does [this and this].
It sends emails for [this and this purpose].

Protection:
- All emails follow with SPF and DKIM specifications.
- All emails contain "List-Unsubscribe" headers for one-click unsubscribe.
- Have enabled SASL and firewall to send emails only from internal IPs.
- Have registered on Google Postmaster and Outlook's SNDS to track IP reputation.
- All complaints and bounces are immediately dealt with.

Quality:
- We email only registered users who ask for email updates.
- We have not purchased any email list.
```

Sometimes we need to provide details about what has changed:

```txt
Hi,

It seems <service provide> is blocking emails from our email server with IP <this.this.this.this>.

We shifted hour hosting to <this-this-host> on <this-date>. We have enabled firewalls and taken all the protection to prevent any spam from this ip.
```
